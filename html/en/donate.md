## [Donate](#!donate)

The development and support of such big project and keeping the trilingual documentation in the actual state requires hundreds of hours of work. If you have a business and your team uses Matrehka.js, that's the good reason to support it. You can be sure that the project will be maintained as it happened before because the developer gets actual profit. If you're individual developer you can buy me a pizza. Every donation is valuable.
