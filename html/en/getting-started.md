## [Getting started](#!getting-started)
All popular frameworks include lots of convenient and interesting functions. The problem is that it is difficult for a beginner to understand where to start his training. A great number of functional possibilities of a given framework leads us to the reasonable question "Hey, do I have to learn all that?"

This issue has been resolved in this documentation. We have split up the API into three parts.

### [[i class="imp-level-1"]][[/i]] The first level - the most important stuff
After you've learned the most important API parts you can hardily start doing fantastic things. Classes, methods and properties marked with [[i class="imp-level-1"]][[/i]] need to be learned primarily.

### [[i class="imp-level-2"]][[/i]] The second level - recommended to learn
If you already know the quick-start basics, you can look at other methods and properties of Matreshka.

### [[i class="imp-level-3"]][[/i]] The third level - other methods and properties
We've hidden rarely used parts (Matreshka API is really rich). If you want to know everything about Matreshka, turn on "Advanced mode" checkbox from the menu.

**Warning**. If you open a link to a method or a property of the third level of importance, the "Advanced mode" is turned on automatically.
